11. Modify the result of the previous problem in such a way that if an element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E) lists.

12. Given a run-length code list generated as specified in the previous problem, construct its uncompressed version.

13. Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly. I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists containing the duplicates, as in problem "Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists", but only count them. As in problem "Modified run-length encoding", simplify the result list by replacing the singleton lists (1 X) by X.

14. Duplicate the elements of a list
15. Replicate the elements of a list a given number of times
16. Drop every N'th element from a list. 
17. Split a list into two parts; the length of the first part is given
18. Extract a slice from a list. 
19. Rotate a list N places to the left
20. Remove the K'th element from a list.
